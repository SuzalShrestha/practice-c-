# C++ Workspace

This workspace contains various C++ programs demonstrating different concepts.

## Structure

The workspace is organized with each program in its own directory. Here are some of the programs included:

- [arrayofobject](arrayofobject.cpp): A program that demonstrates the use of an array of objects.
- [arrayofpointers](arrayofpointers.cpp): A program that demonstrates the use of an array of pointers.
- [basicToClass](basicToClass.cpp): A program that converts a basic C++ program to a class-based program.
- [binaryOperatorOverloading](binaryOperatorOverloading.cpp): A program that demonstrates the overloading of binary operators in C++.
- [class](class.cpp): A program that demonstrates the basic structure and usage of a class in C++.
- [classTemplate](classTemplate.cpp): A program that demonstrates the use of class templates in C++.
- [ClasstoBasic](ClasstoBasic.cpp): A program that converts a class-based C++ program to a basic C++ program.
- [complex](complex.cpp): A program that demonstrates the implementation of complex numbers in C++.
- [constructor](constructor.cpp): A program that demonstrates the use of constructors in C++.
- [employee](employee.cpp): A program to write information of employee in a file and display in console.
- [exception](exception.cpp): A program that demonstrates the use of exception handling in C++.
- [fileHandling](fileHandling.cpp): A program that demonstrates file handling in C++.
- [friend](friend.cpp): A program that demonstrates the use of friend functions and friend classes in C++.
- [inheritance](inheritance.cpp): A program that demonstrates the concept of inheritance in C++.
- [multipleCatch](multipleCatch.cpp): A program that demonstrates the use of multiple catch blocks for different exceptions in C++.
- [namespace](namespace.cpp): A program that demonstrates the use of namespaces in C++.
- [objectArgument](objectArgument.cpp): A program that demonstrates the use of objectsas function arguments in C++.

## Running the Programs

Each program can be run individually. For example, to run the `fileHandling` program, navigate to its directory and run the following command:

```bash
g++ fileHandling.cpp -o fileHandling
./fileHandling
